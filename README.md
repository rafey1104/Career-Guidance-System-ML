# Career-Guidance-System-ML
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Upon graduation, many students are faced with the daunting question, "What's next?" This question is particularly challenging for engineering students, given the multitude of career options within the field. It's crucial for students to assess their capabilities and interests during their academic journey to make informed career choices. To address this issue, we propose an ML-based "Career Guidance System" tailored to students, especially those in their pre-final and final years. This system aims to assist students in identifying suitable job roles based on their academic performance and other relevant evaluations.</p>
<h2> Existing System</h2>
<p>Currently, engineering students typically seek career guidance from seniors, mentors, professors, and parents. Some may also consult career counselors. However, this approach has several drawbacks, including limited counselor knowledge, uncertain outcomes, potential counselor bias, and the cost of counseling services.</p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>Our proposed "Career Guidance System" takes a holistic approach to career recommendation by considering various factors such as academic performance, technical skills, hobbies, interests, psychometric assessments, skills, and knowledge. Machine learning algorithms will process these inputs and suggest suitable job roles. The primary ML algorithms we plan to employ include:</p>
 <ul>
                <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
                <li>XG Boost</li>
                <li>Decision Tree</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Timeline</h2>
<h3>Step-1</h3>
<p>Data Collection: Gather an appropriate dataset with parameters such as academic scores, specialization programs, analytic capabilities, personal details like hobbies, workshops, certifications, and preferred books.
Data Pre-processing: Organize the acquired data, cleaning null values, invalid data, and unwanted information.
One-Hot Encoding: Convert categorical values into a numerical format to make them usable for machine learning algorithms.
Study various algorithms required for the project's implementation.</p>
